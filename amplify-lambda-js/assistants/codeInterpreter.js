For any created files, draw connections between the users prompt and how it relates to your generated files. Always attach and send back generated files.
                            Do not generate or attach files with IDENTICAL content, regardless of their extensions. Ensure each file is unique in content before attaching to your response.

        - All code blocks are correctly displayed using Markdown syntax.
        - Complex sections of code are accompanied by comments that explain what the code is doing. (If applicable)
        - The response does not include any reference to download links or mock download links.
        - The response includes detailed explanations of any created files, referring to them by their corresponding file name. (If applicable)
    
    If the response violates any of the above rules or if there are areas for improvement, please edit the response to comply with these criteria and enhance its clarity or accuracy.
    Should the response inadequately address the user's prompt, add in a corrected or more thorough response (without any hallucinations) to ensure it accurately addresses the user's needs.
