# AWS Serverless, Langchain, and Amplify Integration Example

## Overview

This repository serves as a baseline example for integrating AWS Serverless Framework, Langchain, and AWS Amplify. It demonstrates a secure, scalable, and cost-effective architecture that leverages JWTs issued by Amazon Cognito and AWS Secrets Manager for managing sensitive information.

## Features

- **AWS Serverless Framework**: Utilize AWS Lambda functions for executing backend logic without provisioning or managing servers.
- **Langchain**: Incorporate Langchain to enable advanced language model capabilities within the serverless environment.
- **AWS Amplify**: Build and deploy scalable mobile and web applications with a powerful set of tools and services.
- **Amazon Cognito**: Authenticate and authorize users securely using JWTs.
- **AWS Secrets Manager**: Protect secrets needed to access your applications, services, and IT resources.

## Prerequisites

- AWS Account
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- Node.js and npm installed
- AWS Amplify CLI installed

## Setup and Deployment

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary npm packages.

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. **Install Python Dependencies**: Set up a virtual environment:

    ```sh
    python3.10 venv ./venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Deploy Backend**: Deploy the serverless backend components using the AWS Serverless Framework.

    ```sh
    sls deploy --stage dev
    ```

5. **Run the Application**: Start the web or mobile application locally or deploy it:

    ```sh
    sls offline --httpPort 3015 --stage dev
    ```

## Architecture

The application architecture leverages AWS Lambda for backend logic, Amazon Cognito for user authentication, and AWS Secrets Manager for secret storage. Langchain is integrated within the Lambda functions to provide advanced language processing capabilities.

## Security

Security is a top priority in this example. JWTs from Amazon Cognito ensure that only authenticated users can access the application, while AWS Secrets Manager securely handles sensitive information.
