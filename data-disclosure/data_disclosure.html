<p class="p3"><span class="s3">You may securely share most confidential Vanderbilt data up to data classification “Level 3” with Amplify, including most personal data and student data covered by FERPA.

Generally, if you have access to Level 4 information you are already aware of its sensitivity, but it is your responsibility to confirm the Data Classification Level of Vanderbilt data before you share it with Amplify.
